summary: The `prioritizr` R package provide a flexible interface for building
  and solving systematic conservation prioritization problems using integer 
  linear programming (ILP). It supports a broad range of objectives, 
  constraints, and penalties that can be used to custom-tailor prioritization 
  problems to the specific needs of a conservation planning exercise. For more 
  details, watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da7r3Qyn6ag) by 
  lead developer [Jeff Hanson](https://jeffrey-hanson.com/).
