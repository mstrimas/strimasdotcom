I write code and build tools to turn biodiversity data into conservation and science insights. As part of the [eBird Status and Trends](https://ebird.org/science) team at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, I help develop species distribution models to estimate the occurrence, abundance, and population trends of bird species at a high spatiotemporal resolution using data generated by the citizen-science project [eBird](https://ebird.org/). I work on all facets of this project, from model testing and development to visualization of model results.

 To ensure eBird data are widely and correctly used in science and conservation, I produce [data products](https://ebird.org/science/status-and-trends/download-data), build [open](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/) [source](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebirdst/) [tools](https://prioritizr.net/), develop [educational resources](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebird-best-practices/), and teach [workshops](http://strimas.com/ebp-workshop/).
